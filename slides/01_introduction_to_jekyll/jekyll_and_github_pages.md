### Jekyll and Github pages

Jekyll is the engine powering Github Pages, a tool allowing you to manage and host Jekyll site for free.
All Github repositories allow you to use Jekyll. The setup is a little bit diff√©rent for projects than for 
users or organisations but it remains quite simple.

By combining Jekyll and Github pages, you will get yourself a collaborative environment, free hosting and 
a website fully managed with Git.
