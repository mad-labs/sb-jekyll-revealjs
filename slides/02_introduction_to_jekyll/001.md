## So what is Jekyll, exactly?

**Jekyll is a simple**, blog-aware, **static site generator**. **It takes a template directory** containing raw
text files in various formats, runs it through a converter 
(like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)) and our 
[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) renderer, 
**and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website** suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

**Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind** [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

### Why use a static site generator?

* **Simple**: No other configuration than static website hosting.

* **Secure**: No database to hack. No latency due to using HTTPS

* **Great Performance**: Pages are just HTML. No database calls, no complex layers of caching needed.

* **Cheap**: Hosting is free or cheap and costs don't increase with load. Can use a CDN (see performance).

* **Allows for complexity**: Do anything you want on a page because queries aren't being executed at load time.

* **Efficient**: Minimal infrastructure to manage. Easy to start a project, or create a feature branch and throw it on a staging server.
