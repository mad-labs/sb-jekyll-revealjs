### Creating pages

In addition to writing posts, another thing you may want to do with your Jekyll site is create static pages. By taking advantage of the way Jekyll copies files and directories, this is easy to do.

There are two main ways of creating pages:

* Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.

* Create a folder in the site’s root for each page, and place an index.html or index.md file in each page folder.

Both methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the resulting URLs.
